# Implementing TDD in the Cardinal Health - Track & Trace Project

Implementing Test-Driven Development (TDD) in your Cardinal Health - Track & Trace Project could have been a strategic approach to enhance the project's reliability and maintainability. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how you might have implemented TDD in this project, with examples:

## 1. Understand the Requirement

Before starting with the code, understand the feature or bug fix you're about to work on. For the Cardinal Health project, let's consider implementing a new service for processing EPCIS documents for the 3PL business unit.

## 2. Write a Failing Test

Start by writing a test that fails because the feature isn’t implemented yet. For example, adding functionality to parse EPCIS documents:

```java
@Test
public void shouldExtractDataFromEPCISDocument() {
    EPCISDocumentProcessor processor = new EPCISDocumentProcessor();
    String sampleDocument = "..."; // EPCIS document content
    Map<String, Object> expectedData = Map.of(...); // Expected data extraction result
    
    assertEquals(expectedData, processor.extractData(sampleDocument));
}
```

3. Write the Minimum Code to Pass the Test
Write just enough code to make the test pass, encouraging clean and simple code:

```java

public class EPCISDocumentProcessor {
    public Map<String, Object> extractData(String document) {
        // Minimal logic to pass the test
        return new HashMap<>();
    }
}
```
4. Refactor
With a passing test, refactor your code to improve its structure, readability, and performance:

```java

public class EPCISDocumentProcessor {
    public Map<String, Object> extractData(String document) {
        // Implement actual logic to parse and extract data
    }
}
```
5. Repeat
Continue this cycle for each piece of functionality. Further tests might include handling invalid documents or different types of data extraction.
